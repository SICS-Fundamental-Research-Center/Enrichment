For support and increased lock down, the Tiempo Legend 6 includes an internal microfiber cage in the midfoot to bring the upper closer to the foot, providing a 1-to-1 fit that will help enhance that dominating touch on the ball.Working in tandem with the midfoot cage, the molded heel counter will conform to the natural shape of the foot to prevent any heel slippage, while a microfiber cloth on top of the insole also works to eliminate any foot movement within the boot.TOUCH:For instant control on the ball, the Tiempo Legend 6 features adaptive K-leather on the vamp of the cleats. This leather is vacuum pressed to the interior cage to provide a quilted effect, for superior touch when passing and receiving the ball.With the leather vacuum pressed, this reduces the amount of water uptake to keep the upper remaining soft and light, while ACC (All Conditions Control) technology provides optimal ball control in both wet and dry conditions.TRACTION:A full length engineered TPU plate and insole board work together to provide these Nike soccer cleats with a smooth transition from midfoot to forefoot and multi-directional flexibility.The SG-Pro stud configuration features fixed studs and two sets of screw-in aluminium studs (11/13mm and 13/15mm) for versatile traction, comfort and underfoot control on soft ground.\n                                \"@en ","description_right":"\"Null\"@pl ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Nike Tiempo Legend VI SG-Pro - Black/White/Black/Metallic Gold\"@en \" Nike Mens Boots Soft Ground Gold \"@en","title_right":" \"NIKE AIR MAX 90 MESH BG\"@pl \"Buty obuwie sportowe dla dzieci Nike. ✓ Darmowa dostawa ★ Sizeer ★\"@pl"}

As this underground music scene rose to the street surface, the Puma Suede started making moves among break dance crews and hip-hop club-goers.This revolution, like others, disrupted the norm. It followed the logic of the decade. And so did PUMA. Puma felt the culture shift beneath their feet from strict convention into self-expression.

The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary.Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look.

A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise.

Worn by Gerard Piqué, Jérôme Boateng and Andrea Pirlo, the 6th iteration Tiempo Legend furthers its reputation for providing unrivalled fit, touch and traction to establish a new era for this modern classic.FIT:To provide a fit worthy of the Tiempo Legend title, the cleats feature a new integrated tongue construction, which will ensure the tongue won’t slide providing a consistent fit. For support and increased lock down, the Tiempo Legend 6 includes an internal microfiber cage in the midfoot to bring the upper closer to the foot, providing a 1-to-1 fit that will help enhance that dominating touch on the ball.Working in tandem with the midfoot cage, the molded heel counter will conform to the natural shape of the foot to prevent any heel slippage, while a microfiber cloth on top of the insole also works to eliminate any foot movement within the boot.TOUCH:For instant control on the ball, the Tiempo Legend 6 features adaptive K-leather on the vamp of the cleats. This leather is vacuum pressed to the interior cage to provide a quilted effect, for superior touch when passing and receiving the ball.With the leather vacuum pressed, this reduces the amount of water uptake to keep the upper remaining soft and light, while ACC (All Conditions Control) technology provides optimal ball control in both wet and dry conditions.TRACTION:A full length engineered TPU plate and insole board work together to provide these Nike soccer cleats with a smooth transition from midfoot to forefoot and multi-directional flexibility.The SG-Pro stud configuration features fixed studs and two sets of screw-in aluminium studs (11/13mm and 13/15mm) for versatile traction, comfort and underfoot control on soft ground.\n                                \"@en ","description_right":null,"keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Nike Tiempo Legend VI SG-Pro - Black/White/Black/Metallic Gold\"@en \" Nike Mens Boots Soft Ground Gold \"@en","title_right":" \"Nike Tiempo Genio II Leather FG - Light Crimson/Metallic Silver/Total Crimson\"@en \" Nike Soccer Cleats Firm Ground Crimson \"@en"}

For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Flywire technology is integrated with the laces and Flyknit upper for a dynamic midfoot fit, along with asymmetrical lacing that follows the natural lines of the foot to help reduce lace pressure.Please be advised that the Nike Free shoe collection seems to be coming up slightly large by half a size and as a result we recommend considering half a size smaller.Features Include:Strong lightweight Flyknit upper construction provides a sock-like fit.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire cables integrate with the laces for a dynamic midfoot fit.Notch in the collar allows for easy on and off.Asymmetrical lacing follows the natural lines of the foot to help reduce lace pressure.\n                                \"@en ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Nike Womens Free Run Flyknit - Nero/Bianco\"@it \" Nike Scarpe Uomo Nero/Bianco \"@it","title_right":" \"Nike Free Run Flyknit - Black/White\"@en \" Nike Black/White Mens Shoes 831069-001 \"@en"}

Worn by athletic greats such as basketball's Walt 'Clyde' Frazier and the track 's Tommie Smith, it rose to new levels of fame in the early days of b-boys and funk beats. As this underground music scene rose to the street surface, the Puma Suede started making moves among break dance crews and hip-hop club-goers.This revolution, like others, disrupted the norm. It followed the logic of the decade. And so did PUMA. Puma felt the culture shift beneath their feet from strict convention into self-expression. They responded by translating sports gear into street wear.The Puma Suede tells the story of sport-inspired style. This time-honoured member of the PUMA Archive continues to evolve with the times while maintaining its smooth silhouette, swagger and grit. The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary. Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look. Basketball legend Walt 'Clyde' Frazier inspired PUMA's infamous 'Clyde' silhouette and made some of his best moves in the Puma Suede.'B-Boy' is short for  'break-boy ' as in 'a break dancing boy'. A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise. In a past life, the Puma Suede was a sport hero: In 1968, it was worn by track and field champion Tommie Smith at the Summer Games.'Airtracks' are said to be the toughest and most dangerous break dance moves in existence - cue the Puma Suede treads for traction and take-off.\n                                \"@en ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Vans Classic Slip-On black (VN-0EYEBLK)\"@eu (VN-0EYEBLK) | Bludshop.com\"@eu","title_right":" \"Puma Suede Classic+ - Black\"@en \" Mens Shoes Puma Black 352634-03 \"@en"}

Worn by athletic greats such as basketball's Walt 'Clyde' Frazier and the track 's Tommie Smith, it rose to new levels of fame in the early days of b-boys and funk beats. As this underground music scene rose to the street surface, the Puma Suede started making moves among break dance crews and hip-hop club-goers.This revolution, like others, disrupted the norm. It followed the logic of the decade. And so did PUMA. Puma felt the culture shift beneath their feet from strict convention into self-expression. They responded by translating sports gear into street wear.The Puma Suede tells the story of sport-inspired style. This time-honoured member of the PUMA Archive continues to evolve with the times while maintaining its smooth silhouette, swagger and grit. The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary. Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look. Basketball legend Walt 'Clyde' Frazier inspired PUMA's infamous 'Clyde' silhouette and made some of his best moves in the Puma Suede.'B-Boy' is short for  'break-boy ' as in 'a break dancing boy'. A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise. In a past life, the Puma Suede was a sport hero: In 1968, it was worn by track and field champion Tommie Smith at the Summer Games.'Airtracks' are said to be the toughest and most dangerous break dance moves in existence - cue the Puma Suede treads for traction and take-off.\n                                \"@en ","description_right":"\"\n                                    Partie supérieure 100 % daim pour un confort optimal.Laçage centré, lacets larges pour une forme parfaite.Semelle extérieure antidérapante et résistante au frottement, 100 % caoutchouc.Bande PUMA, logo PUMA Suede Archive et logo PUMA Cat.\n                                \"@fr ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Puma Suede Classic+ - Team Regal Red\"@en \" Mens Shoes Puma Red 352634-05 \"@en","title_right":" \"Puma Suede Classic Eco - Rouge Equipe/ Blanc\"@fr \" Puma chaussures football hommes rouge equipe-blanc \"@fr"}

The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary.Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look.

Worn by athletic greats such as basketball's Walt 'Clyde' Frazier and the track 's Tommie Smith, it rose to new levels of fame in the early days of b-boys and funk beats. As this underground music scene rose to the street surface, the Puma Suede started making moves among break dance crews and hip-hop club-goers.This revolution, like others, disrupted the norm. It followed the logic of the decade. And so did PUMA. Puma felt the culture shift beneath their feet from strict convention into self-expression. They responded by translating sports gear into street wear.The Puma Suede tells the story of sport-inspired style. This time-honoured member of the PUMA Archive continues to evolve with the times while maintaining its smooth silhouette, swagger and grit. The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary. Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look. Basketball legend Walt 'Clyde' Frazier inspired PUMA's infamous 'Clyde' silhouette and made some of his best moves in the Puma Suede.'B-Boy' is short for  'break-boy ' as in 'a break dancing boy'. A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise. In a past life, the Puma Suede was a sport hero: In 1968, it was worn by track and field champion Tommie Smith at the Summer Games.'Airtracks' are said to be the toughest and most dangerous break dance moves in existence - cue the Puma Suede treads for traction and take-off.\n                                \"@en ","description_right":null,"keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Puma Suede Classic+ - Team Regal Red\"@en \" Mens Shoes Puma Red 352634-05 \"@en","title_right":" \"Suede Classic\" \"Puma Suede Classic - 352634-75 | everysize.com\""}

Worn by Gerard Piqué, Jérôme Boateng and Andrea Pirlo, the 6th iteration Tiempo Legend furthers its reputation for providing unrivalled fit, touch and traction to establish a new era for this modern classic.FIT:To provide a fit worthy of the Tiempo Legend title, the cleats feature a new integrated tongue construction, which will ensure the tongue won’t slide providing a consistent fit. For support and increased lock down, the Tiempo Legend 6 includes an internal microfiber cage in the midfoot to bring the upper closer to the foot, providing a 1-to-1 fit that will help enhance that dominating touch on the ball.Working in tandem with the midfoot cage, the molded heel counter will conform to the natural shape of the foot to prevent any heel slippage, while a microfiber cloth on top of the insole also works to eliminate any foot movement within the boot.TOUCH:For instant control on the ball, the Tiempo Legend 6 features adaptive K-leather on the vamp of the cleats. This leather is vacuum pressed to the interior cage to provide a quilted effect, for superior touch when passing and receiving the ball.With the leather vacuum pressed, this reduces the amount of water uptake to keep the upper remaining soft and light, while ACC (All Conditions Control) technology provides optimal ball control in both wet and dry conditions.TRACTION:A full length engineered TPU plate and insole board work together to provide these Nike soccer cleats with a smooth transition from midfoot to forefoot and multi-directional flexibility.The SG-Pro stud configuration features fixed studs and two sets of screw-in aluminium studs (11/13mm and 13/15mm) for versatile traction, comfort and underfoot control on soft ground.\n                                \"@en ","description_right":"\"\n                                    Engineered by Nike, the soft, full grain natural leather upper delivers the unrivalled ball feel that's been a hallmark of Tiempo for almost two decades.

Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39\n                                \"@en ","description_right":null,"keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":" Categoría Hombre Tipo RUNNING Color Blanco, Negro Talla 41, 42, 42,5, 43, 44, 44,5, 45, 46, 47,5 Marca NIKE","title_left":" \"Nike Free RN - Black/White-Anthracite\"@en \" Nike Black/White-Anthracite Mens Shoes 831508-001 \"@en","title_right":" \"Nike Free Rn (831508-001)\"@es-ES (831508-001) - footstop\"@es-ES"}

A full-length compressed nylon chassis is tuned to work naturally with your foot, while the direct injected chevron shaped studs offer superior traction on firm natural grass surfaces.\n                                \"@en ","description_right":"\"\n                                    The third in a series of seven cleats chronicling Cristiano Ronaldo’s journey, Chapter 3 focuses on the game that brought him to the attention of one of the world’s biggest clubs. To celebrate the moment of his discovery, the Nike Mercurial Superfly features a dark green that’s inspired by his original club colours and neon accents to represent his shining talent.  FITDeveloped around the idea of a racecar fit, the Superfly V features a new V16 last, which is designed to engage the major metatarsal by shaping the outsole to the natural contours of your foot. This allows the metatarsals to sit lower in the boot while the big toe is slightly raised, increasing flex across the joint and allowing you to generate maximum power when sprinting off the mark.Constructed with a Flyknit and NikeSkin upper, the Superfly features an upgraded tongue less construction, while the Flywire cables within the upper are independently able to react to how the foot is engaging with the ground for optimal lockdown. To reduce the loss of elasticity over time, the Dynamic Fit collar has a tighter knit construction to enhance your proprioception with the ground, while its internal anti-skid top cloth eliminates any foot movement within the boot.TOUCHTo enhance your touch and feel, the Superfly V features a new 3-D textured Speed Rib construction, which is knitted into the cleat’s Flyknit upper to create increased friction on the ball for high-speed control.  Applied with Nike’s All Conditions Control (ACC) Technology, the Superfly provides consistent levels of grip on the ball in wet and dry weather conditions.TRACTIONRedesigned to improve your acceleration, the Superfly’s chassis is made from compressed Nylon, which is 40% lighter than the Carbon Fibre plate used for the Superfly IV. More responsive and shaped to the anatomical V-16 last, the soleplate features chevron shaped cleat studs for quick ground penetration, release and braking on firm natural grass surfaces.\n                                \"@en ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Nike Mercurial Veloce III Ronaldo FG - Seaweed/Volt/Hasta/White\"@en \" Nike Mens Soccer Cleats Firm Ground Seaweed/Volt/Hasta/White \"@en","title_right":" \"Nike Mercurial Superfly V Ronaldo FG - Seaweed/Volt/Hasta/White\"@en \" Nike Mens Boots Firm Ground Seaweed/Volt/Hasta/White \"@en"}

The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out. \"@en ","description_right":"\"\n                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39\n                                \"@en ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Nike Free RN Men's Running Shoes SP17 101\"@en 101 · Nike Barefoot Trainers ah\"@en","title_right":" \"Nike Free RN - White/Black-Pure Platinum\"@en \" Nike Platinum Mens Shoes 831508-101 \"@en"}

For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Flywire technology is integrated with the laces and Flyknit upper for a dynamic midfoot fit, along with asymmetrical lacing that follows the natural lines of the foot to help reduce lace pressure.Please be advised that the Nike Free shoe collection seems to be coming up slightly large by half a size and as a result we recommend considering half a size smaller.Features Include:Strong lightweight Flyknit upper construction provides a sock-like fit.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire cables integrate with the laces for a dynamic midfoot fit.Notch in the collar allows for easy on and off.Asymmetrical lacing follows the natural lines of the foot to help reduce lace pressure.\n                                \"@en ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":" Categoría Hombre Tipo RUNNING Color Blanco, Negro Talla 41, 42,5, 43, 44, 44,5, 45, 46 Marca NIKE","specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Nike Free Rn Flyknit (831069-001)\"@es-ES (831069-001) - footstop\"@es-ES","title_right":" \"Nike Free RN Flyknit - Black/White\"@en \" Nike Black/White Mens Shoes 831069-001 \"@en"}

For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Flywire technology is integrated with the laces and Flyknit upper for a dynamic midfoot fit, along with asymmetrical lacing that follows the natural lines of the foot to help reduce lace pressure.Please be advised that the Nike Free shoe collection seems to be coming up slightly large by half a size and as a result we recommend considering half a size smaller.Features Include:Strong lightweight Flyknit upper construction provides a sock-like fit.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire cables integrate with the laces for a dynamic midfoot fit.Notch in the collar allows for easy on and off.Asymmetrical lacing follows the natural lines of the foot to help reduce lace pressure.\n                                \"@en ","description_right":"\"Ciabatte da piscina o per il tempo libero di Nike, modello Benassi JDI.<br />\nSuola in gomma antiscivolo.<br />\nSottopiede in giomma morbida per il massimo comfort.<br />\nBanda superiore imbottita, con parte superiore esterna in similpelle.<br />\nStampa del logo e della scritta Nike di colore Bianco.<br />\nColore: Blu navy.<br />\n<br />\"@en ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":" SKU 343880 403 Brand Nike Product category Man Free Time Slippers Color Blue EAN 0884751728938 -Size 41 0884751734588 -Size 45 0884751734601 -Size 46","title_left":" \"Nike Free RN Flyknit - Black/White\"@en \" Nike Black/White Mens Shoes 831069-001 \"@en","title_right":" \"NIKE BENASSI JDI\"@en JDI - MAN FREE TIME SLIPPERS Nike colour Blue 343880 403 Athletic footwear apparel and sports equipment\"@en"}

Worn by Gerard Piqué, Jérôme Boateng and Andrea Pirlo, the 6th iteration Tiempo Legend furthers its reputation for providing unrivalled fit, touch and traction to establish a new era for this modern classic.FIT:To provide a fit worthy of the Tiempo Legend title, the cleats feature a new integrated tongue construction, which will ensure the tongue won’t slide providing a consistent fit. For support and increased lock down, the Tiempo Legend 6 includes an internal microfiber cage in the midfoot to bring the upper closer to the foot, providing a 1-to-1 fit that will help enhance that dominating touch on the ball.Working in tandem with the midfoot cage, the molded heel counter will conform to the natural shape of the foot to prevent any heel slippage, while a microfiber cloth on top of the insole also works to eliminate any foot movement within the boot.TOUCH:For instant control on the ball, the Tiempo Legend 6 features adaptive K-leather on the vamp of the cleats. This leather is vacuum pressed to the interior cage to provide a quilted effect, for superior touch when passing and receiving the ball.With the leather vacuum pressed, this reduces the amount of water uptake to keep the upper remaining soft and light, while ACC (All Conditions Control) technology provides optimal ball control in both wet and dry conditions.TRACTION:A full length engineered TPU plate and insole board work together to provide these Nike soccer cleats with a smooth transition from midfoot to forefoot and multi-directional flexibility.The SG-Pro stud configuration features fixed studs and two sets of screw-in aluminium studs (11/13mm and 13/15mm) for versatile traction, comfort and underfoot control on soft ground.\n                                \"@en ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Nike Tiempo Legend VI SG-Pro -Negro/Blanco/Dorado metalizado\"@es \" Nike -Botas de futbol-Terrenos blandos-Negro/Blanco/Dorado metalizado \"@es","title_right":" \"Nike Tiempo Legend VI SG-Pro - Black/White/Black/Metallic Gold\"@en \" Nike Mens Boots Soft Ground Gold \"@en"}

Designed for intelligent playmakers like Mario Götze, Blaise Matudi and Kevin De Bruyne they see passes that others don’t to orchestrate attacking chances for their team.FITFor a defining fit and feel, the Magista Obra II features a new Flyknit upper, which has been engineered to provide a sock-like feel and eliminate any space around the foot for a glove-like fit. Knitted directly into the upper on the medial and lateral sides is the Magista’s Flywire cables, which run from the eyelets to the bite line for strategic lockdown, while an internal heel counter keeps the ankle stable and secure.Redesigned to link the lower leg and foot, the Dynamic Fit collar is shaped to fit the natural outline of your malleolus for a more secure and protective fit, while its tighter knit construction ensures better shape retention. TOUCH A new thermoformed Flyknit upper creates a 3-D textured upper for more friction on the ball, while ACC (All Conditions Controlled) Technology provides a consistent touch on the ball in both wet and dry conditions. The laces have been moved slightly to the medial side to create a larger surface area when striking the ball, while the tongue-less construction features added padding to ensure your touch on the ball is responsive.TRACTION   Lighter than the previous version, the Magista’s soleplate sees a reduction of Pebax for its nylon chassis, which has reduced the overall weight of the plate from 85g to 62g. This reduction allows the foot to get closer to ground, meaning a better and responsive feel when changing direction.   The stud pattern utilised for the Magista had been created using Fine Element Analysis (FEA), which is a computerised method that produces data to design a soleplate ideal for rotational traction on firm ground surfaces.\n                                \"@en ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Nike Kids Magista Obra II FG - Rio Teal/Volt/Obsidian/Clear Jade\"@en \" Nike Mens Boots Firm Ground Jade \"@en","title_right":" \"Nike Magista Obra II FG - Rio Teal/Volt/Obsidian/Clear Jade\"@en \" Nike Mens Boots Firm Ground Jade \"@en"}

In 2002, they examined a group of men and women with pressure measuring insoles taped to their feet, using high-speed cameras to capture images of each foot in motion. The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of shoeless running. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional running shoe from the inside out.\n \"@en ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Nike Womens Free 5.0 - Black/White-Dark Grey-Dove Grey-Wolf Grey\"@en \" Nike Shoes Grey \"@en","title_right":" \"Nike Free 5.0 Women's Running Shoes SU15 002\"@en 002 · Nike Barefoot Trainers ah\"@en"}

The team spent eight years studying the biomechanics of runners' feet in motion. The results yielded a profound understanding of the foot's natural landing angle, pressure and toe position, allowing Nike designers to build an unconventional and flexible running shoe from the inside out. \"@en ","description_right":"\"\n                                    The new Nike Free RUN draws upon new studies that reveal how the foot expands and contracts upon impact with the ground. For this reason, Nike designers have developed an auxetic midsole that allows it to splay upon impact without it thinning out (think about stretching an elastic band, which thins out when it’s pulled apart and is then compromised at its weakest point). Spreading across two planes, the geometric tri-star form mimics how the body and foot react to force and accounts for the massive changes in foot size (approximately one size in length and two sizes in width) that occur throughout a runner’s stride to deliver support and flexibility.Revolutionary, never before used Soft Foam provides comfort and cushioning without compromising natural motion.Offering breathability with an engineered mesh upper, the new Free RUN incorporates Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive, supportive fit.Features Include:Engineered mesh upper supports as it moves with you.Low-profile cushioning and rounded heel encourage natural footstrike.Auxetic tri-star outsole pattern expands with your step for flexible cushioning.Flywire technology integrated with the laces for an adaptive supportive fit.Offset: 8mm Last: QD-39\n                                \"@en ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Nike Free RN Men's Running Shoes SU16 400\"@en 400 · Nike Barefoot Trainers ah\"@en","title_right":" \"Nike Free Run - Concord/Black-Hyper Cobalt-Photo Blue\"@en \" Nike Blue Mens Shoes 831508-400 \"@en"}

Der Nike Air Max BW Midnight Navy wird bei dieser Ausführung stolz in Dunkelblau, Weiß und Schwarz zur Schau gestellt. Sneakerfreunde werden sich über diese Farbgebung freuen und können Luftsprünge dank eingebauter Luftpolsterung ohne spätere Folgeschäden durchführen.\nWas sich im Obermaterial wiederfinden lässt, stellt sich als Meshstoff heraus und überzieht außer der Zehentasche sowie Teile der Seiten den Oberschuh in Dunkelblau. Eine dunkelblaue Trennlinie aus synthetischem Stoff umrandet den ganzen Schuh einmal. Darüber wurde ein Schweif aus Gummi wiederholt in Dunkelblau gelegt, der einen eindrucksvollen Ausdruck präsentiert. An dem Hacken sieht man Air Max als Namen aus Gummi in Dunkelblau. Noch weiter in Richtung Sohle behauptet sich eine Perforierung wieder in Dunkelblau.\nDie Füße können in weichen Meshstoff in Dunkelblau tauchen und fühlen sich, im Inneren angekommen, gleich pudelwohl. Angedeutet wird der Name \"Nike Air\" auf der Zunge erneut in Dunkelblau. Seitlich sind Schnürsenkelösen in Plastik eingearbeitet worden, die Halt für die dunkelblauen Bänder liefern. Kleine Plastikapplikationen in Dunkelblau setzen sich neben diese Halterung und peppen den oberen Teil des Schuhes Ton in Ton auf.\nIn die Zwischensohle baut Nike die viel gelobte Luftkammern-Technik (Air-Technologie) ein, die beim Auftritt für eine Dämpfung sorgt. Sie ist zusammen mit einem Teil der Sohle in Weiß ein absoluter Hingucker und zieht die Blicke förmlich auf sich. Durch kleine Fenster aus Kunststoff kann in das Technik-Zentrum gesehen werden und man bekommt ein Gefühl für die schon seit vielen Jahren bekannte Einbauweise. Als Laufsohle wurde schwarzes Gummi verwendet, das auch zur Wasserabweisung dient und einen festen Stand gewährt.\nFazit:\nUnserer Meinung nach lassen sich diese Sneakers sowohl in der Freizeit als auch für diverse Sportarten tragen. Gerade wer Stabilität als wichtiges Attribut ansieht, hat mit dem Nike Air Max BW die richtige Wahl getroffen. Super bequem und außerdem zu vielen Kleidungsstücken kombinierbar ist der Schuh der perfekte Begleiter im Alltag.\nEigenschaften:\n\nLeder und Synthetik sichern eine Langlebigkeit des Sneakers ab\nFarbwahl von Dunkelblau, Weiß und Schwarz\nExtra großes Sichtfenster verleiht Blick auf die Air-Dämpfungseinheit\nLaufsohle aus Gummi in Schwarz\n\n\"@de ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":{"Artikel Nr.:":"881981-400","Hersteller:":"Nike","Typ:":"Laufschuh","Farbe:":"Midnight Navy/Midnight Navy","Hergestellt in:":"Vietnam","Zustand:":"Brand Neu in Original Box","Material:":"Leder, Synthetik","Veröffentlicht :":"Juli 2017"},"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":" Artikel Nr.: 881981-400 Hersteller: Nike Typ: Laufschuh Farbe: Midnight Navy/Midnight Navy Hergestellt in: Vietnam Zustand: Brand Neu in Original Box Material: Leder, Synthetik Veröffentlicht : Juli 2017","title_left":" \"Nike Sportswear Air Force 1 07 - White\"@en \" Mens Shoes Nike White 315122-111 \"@en","title_right":" \"Nike Air Max BW\"@de BW Dunkelblau Weiss Schwarz 881981-400 - Purchaze\"@de"}

Worn by Gerard Piqué, Jérôme Boateng and Andrea Pirlo, the 6th iteration Tiempo Legend furthers its reputation for providing unrivalled fit, touch and traction to establish a new era for this modern classic.FIT:To provide a fit worthy of the Tiempo Legend title, the cleats feature a new integrated tongue construction, which will ensure the tongue won’t slide providing a consistent fit. For support and increased lock down, the Tiempo Legend 6 includes an internal microfiber cage in the midfoot to bring the upper closer to the foot, providing a 1-to-1 fit that will help enhance that dominating touch on the ball.Working in tandem with the midfoot cage, the molded heel counter will conform to the natural shape of the foot to prevent any heel slippage, while a microfiber cloth on top of the insole also works to eliminate any foot movement within the boot.TOUCH:For instant control on the ball, the Tiempo Legend 6 features adaptive K-leather on the vamp of the cleats. This leather is vacuum pressed to the interior cage to provide a quilted effect, for superior touch when passing and receiving the ball.With the leather vacuum pressed, this reduces the amount of water uptake to keep the upper remaining soft and light, while ACC (All Conditions Control) technology provides optimal ball control in both wet and dry conditions.TRACTION:A full length engineered TPU plate and insole board work together to provide these Nike soccer cleats with a smooth transition from midfoot to forefoot and multi-directional flexibility.The SG-Pro stud configuration features fixed studs and two sets of screw-in aluminium studs (11/13mm and 13/15mm) for versatile traction, comfort and underfoot control on soft ground.\n                                \"@en ","description_right":"\"\n                                    ROZPOCZNIJ KONIECRozpocznij każdy atak na boisku w nowych butach piłkarskich Nike Tiempo 6.

As this underground music scene rose to the street surface, the Puma Suede started making moves among break dance crews and hip-hop club-goers.This revolution, like others, disrupted the norm. It followed the logic of the decade. And so did PUMA. Puma felt the culture shift beneath their feet from strict convention into self-expression. They responded by translating sports gear into street wear.The Puma Suede tells the story of sport-inspired style. This time-honoured member of the PUMA Archive continues to evolve with the times while maintaining its smooth silhouette, swagger and grit. The Puma Suede proves that no matter the decade, the city, the continent -style can be revolutionary.Early break dance crews whole-heartedly adopted the Puma Suede for its sweet tread and smooth, classic look. Basketball legend Walt 'Clyde' Frazier inspired PUMA's infamous 'Clyde' silhouette and made some of his best moves in the Puma Suede.'B-Boy' is short for 'break-boy ' as in 'a break dancing boy'. A growing number of 'B-Girls' are currently on the rise. In a past life, the Puma Suede was a sport hero: In 1968, it was worn by track and field champion Tommie Smith at the Summer Games.'Airtracks' are said to be the toughest and most dangerous break dance moves in existence - cue the Puma Suede treads for traction and take-off.Features Include:100% Suede upper for optimum comfortCentrally-positioned lacing with broad laces for a perfect fitNon-slip and abrasion-resistant outer sole made from 100% RubberPUMA formstrip PUMA Suede archive logo and PUMA Cat logo\n                                \"@en ","keyValuePairs_left":null,"keyValuePairs_right":null,"price_left":null,"price_right":null,"specTableContent_left":null,"specTableContent_right":null,"title_left":" \"Puma Suede Classic+ - Cabernet\"@en \" Mens Shoes Puma Cabernet 352634-75 \"@en","title_right":" \"Puma Suede Classic+ - Cabernet\"@en \" Mens Shoes Puma Cabernet 352634-75 \"@en"}
